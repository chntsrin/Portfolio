A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF DIFFERENT ALGORITHMS FOR CLASSIFYING TELECOMMUNICATION CUSTOMER CHURN BEHAVIOR
Abstract
Customer churn is a significant problem for various industries, including the telecommunications industry, as it directly impacts revenue and business stability. Customer churn prediction is crucial for businesses to retain their customer base by predicting the customers most likely to leave and implementing marketing strategies to retain them, such as offering promotions or special benefits for these customers. In previous research on building models for customer churn prediction, different algorithms and data preparation steps were utilized depending on the characteristics of the data used.
This research aims to study and compare customer churn prediction models using a dataset of 7,043 customers in the telecommunications industry. Handling imbalanced data by using methods such as Random Undersampling, Random Oversampling, and SMOTE. The algorithms used for build model include Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM.
The results of the experiments indicate that the model built using the Random Forest algorithm with Random Oversampling for handling imbalanced data achieves the best results, achieving an accuracy of 88.77%, precision of 84.83%, recall of 94.54%, and an AUC of 0.95. Feature importance analysis revealed that total charges, tenure, and monthly charges are the key factors affecting customers' decision to churn.
